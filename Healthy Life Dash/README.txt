HEALTHY LIFE DASH

Healthy Life Dash is an educational 2D game developed with Java.
The game aims to teach children healthy and unhealthy food choices in a fun and interactive way.
Instead of text, the game uses visual and audio feedback, making it suitable for young children.


PROJECT PURPOSE
The main purpose of Healthy Life Dash is to help children develop healthy eating habits at an early age.
Players learn which foods are healthy and which are unhealthy by playing and experiencing their effects in the game.


TARGET AUDIENCE
- Primary school students
- Children who cannot read or write yet

Since the game does not rely on text, it is accessible and easy to understand for young players.


GAMEPLAY
- The player controls a character using the keyboard
- Food items appear randomly on the map
- Healthy foods increase the sugar level
- Unhealthy foods decrease the sugar level
- The goal is to reach the exit door before the sugar level reaches zero
- The game becomes more difficult as levels progress


ENEMIES AND DIFFICULTY
- Enemies follow the player
- Higher levels include more enemies
- If the player collides with an enemy, the game ends
- Collision detection is implemented to handle interactions


VISUAL AND AUDIO FEEDBACK
- Eating healthy food turns the screen green
- Eating unhealthy food turns the screen red
- Background music is included in the game

These effects provide instant feedback and help children understand right and wrong choices.


SAVE AND LOAD SYSTEM
- Players can save their progress
- Saved games can be loaded later to continue playing

This feature improves user experience, especially for young players.
